      "title": "The concept of intelligence",
      "text": "A\nLooked at in one way, everyone knows what intelligence is; looked at in another way, no one\ndoes. In other words, people all have unconscious notions - known as 'implicit theories' -\nof intelligence, but no one knows for certain what it actually is. This chapter addresses how\npeople conceptualize intelligence, whatever it may actually be.\n\nBut why should we even care what people think intelligence is, as opposed only to valuing\nwhatever it actually is? There are at least four reasons people's conceptions of intelligence\nmatter.\n\nB\nFirst, implicit theories of intelligence drive the way in which people perceive and evaluate\ntheir own intelligence and that of others. To better understand the judgments people make\nabout their own and others' abilities, it is useful to learn about people's implicit theories.\nFor example, parents' implicit theories of their children's language development will\ndetermine at what ages they will be willing to make various corrections in their children's\nspeech. More generally, parents' implicit theories of intelligence will determine at what ages\nthey believe their children are ready to perform various cognitive tasks.  Job interviewers\nwill make hiring decisions on the basis of their implicit theories of intelligence. People\nwill decide who to be friends with on the basis of such theories.  In sum, knowledge about\nimplicit theories of intelligence is important because this knowledge is so often used by\npeople to make judgments in the course of their everyday lives.\n\nC\nSecond, the implicit theories of scientific investigators ultimately give rise to their explicit\ntheories.  Thus it is useful to find out what these implicit theories are.  Implicit theories\nprovide a framework that is useful in defining the general scope of a phenomenon -\nespecially a not-well-understood phenomenon.  These implicit theories can suggest what\naspects of the phenomenon have been more or less attended to in previous investigations.\n\nD\nThird, implicit theories can be useful when an investigator suspects that existing explicit\ntheories are wrong or misleading. If an investigation of implicit theories reveals little\ncorrespondence between the extant implicit and explicit theories, the implicit theories may\nbe wrong. But the possibility also needs to be taken into account that the explicit theories\nare wrong and in need of correction or supplementation. For example, some implicit\ntheories of intelligence suggest the need for expansion of some of our explicit theories of\nthe construct.\n\nE\nFinally, understanding implicit theories of intelligence can help elucidate developmental and\ncross-cultural differences.  As mentioned earlier, people have expectations for intellectual\nperformances that differ for children of different ages. How these expectations differ is\nin part a function of culture. For example, expectations for children who participate in\nWestern-style schooling are almost certain to be different from those for children who do\nnot participate in such schooling.\n\nF\nI have suggested that there are three major implicit theories of how intelligence relates to\nsociety as a whole (Sternberg, 1997). These might be called Hamiltonian, Jeffersonian, and\nJacksonian.  These views are not based strictly, but rather, loosely, on the philosophies of\nAlexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and Andrew Jackson, three great statesmen in the\nhistory of the United States.\n\nG\nThe Hamiltonian view, which is similar to the Platonic view, is that people are born with\ndifferent levels of intelligence and that those who are less intelligent need the good offices\nof the more intelligent to keep them in line, whether they are called government officials or,\nin Plato's term, philosopher-kings.  Herrnstein and Murray (1994) seem to have shared this\nbelief when they wrote about the emergence of a cognitive (high-IQ) elite, which eventually\nwould have to take responsibility for the largely irresponsible masses of non-elite (low-IQ)\npeople who cannot take care of themselves. Left to themselves, the unintelligent would\ncreate, as they always have created, a kind of chaos.\n\nH\nThe Jeffersonian view is that people should have equal opportunities, but they do not\nnecessarily avail themselves equally of these opportunities and are not necessarily equally\nrewarded for their accomplishments. People are rewarded for what they accomplish, if given\nequal opportunity. Low achievers are not rewarded to the same extent as high achievers.\nIn the Jeffersonian view, the goal of education is not to favor or foster an elite, as in the\nHamiltonian tradition, but rather to allow children the opportunities to make full use of the\nskills they have.  My own views are similar to these (Sternberg, 1997).\n\nI\nThe Jacksonian view is that all people are equal, not only as human beings but in terms\nof their competencies - that one person would serve as well as another in government or\non a jury or in almost any position of responsibility. In this view of democracy, people are\nessentially intersubstitutable except for specialized skills, all of which can be learned.  In\nthis view, we do not need or want any institutions that might lead to favoring one group\nover another.\n\nJ Implicit theories of intelligence and of the relationship of intelligence to society perhaps\nneed to be considered more carefully than they have been because they often serve as\nunderlying presuppositions for explicit theories and even experimental designs that are then\ntaken as scientific contributions. Until scholars are able to discuss their implicit theories\nand thus their assumptions, they are likely to miss the point of what others are saying when\ndiscussing their explicit theories and their data.",

      "text": "Saving bugs to find new drugs\n\nZoologist Ross Piper looks at the potential of insects in\npharmaceutical research\n\nA\nMore drugs than you might think are derived from, or inspired by, compounds found\nin living things. Looking to nature for the soothing and curing of our ailments is\nnothing new - we have been doing it for tens of thousands of years. You only have\nto look at other primates - such as the capuchin monkeys who rub themselves with\ntoxin-oozing millipedes to deter mosquitoes, or the chimpanzees who use noxious\nforest plants to rid themselves of intestinal parasites - to realise that our ancient\nancestors too probably had a basic grasp of medicine.\n\nB\nPharmaceutical science and chemistry built on these ancient foundations and\nperfected the extraction, characterisation, modification and testing of these natural\nproducts. Then, for a while, modern pharmaceutical science moved its focus away\nfrom nature and into the laboratory, designing chemical compounds from scratch.\nThe main cause of this shift is that although there are plenty of promising chemical\ncompounds in nature, finding them is far from easy. Securing sufficient numbers of\nthe organism in question, isolating and characterising the compounds of interest,\nand producing large quantities of these compounds are all significant hurdles.\n\nC\nLaboratory-based drug discovery has achieved varying levels of success,\nsomething which has now prompted the development of new approaches focusing\nonce again on natural products. With the ability to mine genomes for useful\ncompounds, it is now evident that we have barely scratched the surface of nature's\nmolecular diversity. This realisation, together with several looming health crises,\nsuch as antibiotic resistance, has put bioprospecting - the search for useful\ncompounds in nature - firmly back on the map.\n\nD\nInsects are the undisputed masters of the terrestrial domain, where they occupy\nevery possible niche.  Consequently, they have a bewildering array of interactions\nwith other organisms, something which has driven the evolution of an enormous\nrange of very interesting compounds for defensive and offensive purposes. Their\nremarkable diversity exceeds that of every other group of animals on the planet\ncombined.  Yet even though insects are far and away the most diverse animals in\nexistence, their potential as sources of therapeutic compounds is yet to be realised.\n\nE\nFrom the tiny proportion of insects that have been investigated, several promising\ncompounds have been identified.  For example, alloferon, an antimicrobial\ncompound produced by blow fly larvae, is used as an antiviral and antitumor agent\nin South Korea and Russia. The larvae of a few other insect species are being\ninvestigated for the potent antimicrobial compounds they produce.  Meanwhile, a\ncompound from the venom of the wasp Polybia paulista has potential in cancer\ntreatment.\n\nF\nWhy is it that insects have received relatively little attention in bioprospecting?\nFirstly, there are so many insects that, without some manner of targeted approach,\ninvestigating this huge variety of species is a daunting task. Secondly, insects are\ngenerally very small, and the glands inside them that secrete potentially useful\ncompounds are smaller still. This can make it difficult to obtain sufficient quantities\nof the compound for subsequent testing.  Thirdly, although we consider insects to be\neverywhere, the reality of this ubiquity is vast numbers of a few extremely common\nspecies.  Many insect species are infrequently encountered and very difficult to rear\nin captivity, which, again, can leave us with insufficient material to work with.\n\nG My colleagues and I at Aberystwyth University in the UK have developed an\napproach in which we use our knowledge of ecology as a guide to target our\nefforts. The creatures that particularly interest us are the many insects that secrete\npowerful poison for subduing prey and keeping it fresh for future consumption.\nThere are even more insects that are masters of exploiting filthy habitats, such as\nfaeces and carcasses, where they are regularly challenged by thousands of micro-\norganisms. These insects have many antimicrobial compounds for dealing with\npathogenic bacteria and fungi, suggesting that there is certainly potential to find\nmany compounds that can serve as or inspire new antibiotics.\n\nH\nAlthough natural history knowledge points us in the right direction, it doesn't\nsolve the problems associated with obtaining useful compounds from insects.\nFortunately, it is now possible to snip out the stretches of the insect's DNA that\ncarry the codes for the interesting compounds and insert them into cell lines that\nallow larger quantities to be produced. And although the road from isolating and\ncharacterising compounds with desirable qualities to developing a commercial\nproduct is very long and full of pitfalls, the variety of successful animal-derived\npharmaceuticals on the market demonstrates there is a precedent here that is\nworth exploring.\n\nI\nWith every bit of wilderness that disappears, we deprive ourselves of potential\nmedicines.  As much as I'd love to help develop a groundbreaking insect-derived\nmedicine, my main motivation for looking at insects in this way is conservation.  I\nsincerely believe that all species, however small and seemingly insignificant, have\na right to exist for their own sake. If we can shine a light on the darker recesses\nof nature's medicine cabinet, exploring the useful chemistry of the most diverse\nanimals on the planet, I believe we can make people think differently about the\nvalue of nature.",

      "title": "The power of play",
      "text": "The power of play\n\nVirtually every child, the world over, plays. The drive to play is so intense that children will do so\nin any circumstances, for instance when they have no real toys, or when parents do not actively\nencourage the behavior. In the eyes of a young child, running, pretending, and building are fun.\nResearchers and educators know that these playful activities benefit the development of the\nwhole child across social, cognitive, physical, and emotional domains. Indeed, play is such an\ninstrumental component to healthy child development that the United Nations High Commission\non Human Rights (1989) recognized play as a fundamental right of every child.\n\nYet, while experts continue to expound a powerful argument for the importance of play in\nchildren's lives, the actual time children spend playing continues to decrease. Today, children play\neight hours less each week than their counterparts did two decades ago (Elkind 2008). Under\npressure of rising academic standards, play is being replaced by test preparation in kindergartens\nand grade schools, and parents who aim to give their preschoolers a leg up are led to believe\nthat flashcards and educational 'toys' are the path to success.  Our society has created a false\ndichotomy between play and learning.\n\nThrough play, children learn to regulate their behavior, lay the foundations for later learning in\nscience and mathematics, figure out the complex negotiations of social relationships, build a\nrepertoire of creative problem-solving skills, and so much more. There is also an important role\nfor adults in guiding children through playful learning opportunities.\n\nFull consensus on a formal definition of play continues to elude the researchers and theorists who\nstudy it.  Definitions range from discrete descriptions of various types of play such as physical,\nconstruction, language, or symbolic play (Miller & Almon 2009), to lists of broad criteria, based\non observations and attitudes, that are meant to capture the essence of all play behaviors (e.g.\nRubin et al. 1983).\n\nA majority of the contemporary definitions of play focus on several key criteria.  The founder of\nthe National Institute for Play, Stuart Brown, has described play as 'anything that spontaneously\nis done for its own sake'.  More specifically, he says it 'appears purposeless, produces pleasure\nand joy, [and] leads one to the next stage of mastery' (as quoted in Tippett 2008). Similarly, Miller\nand Almon (2009) say that play includes 'activities that are freely chosen and directed by children\nand arise from intrinsic motivation'. Often, play is defined along a continuum as more or less\nplayful using the following set of behavioral and dispositional criteria (e.g. Rubin et al. 1983):\n\nPlay is pleasurable:  Children must enjoy the activity or it is not play.  It is intrinsically\nmotivated: Children engage in play simply for the satisfaction the behavior itself brings.\nIt has no extrinsically motivated function or goal.  Play is process oriented: When children\n\nplay, the means are more important than the ends. It is freely chosen, spontaneous and\nvoluntary. If a child is pressured, they will likely not think of the activity as play. Play is\nactively engaged:  Players must be physically and/or mentally involved in the activity. Play\nis non-literal.  It involves make-believe.\n\nAccording to this view, children's playful behaviors can range in degree from 0% to 100%\nplayful.  Rubin and colleagues did not assign greater weight to any one dimension in determining\nplayfulness; however, other researchers have suggested that process orientation and a lack of\nobvious functional purpose may be the most important aspects of play (e.g.  Pellegrini 2009).\n\nFrom the perspective of a continuum, play can thus blend with other motives and attitudes that\nare less playful, such as work.  Unlike play, work is typically not viewed as enjoyable and it is\nextrinsically motivated (i.e. it is goal oriented). Researcher Joan Goodman (1994) suggested that\nhybrid forms of work and play are not a detriment to learning; rather, they can provide optimal\ncontexts for learning. For example, a child may be engaged in a difficult, goal-directed activity\nset up by their teacher, but they may still be actively engaged and intrinsically motivated.  At this\nmid-point between play and work, the child's motivation, coupled with guidance from an adult,\ncan create robust opportunities for playful learning.\n\nCritically, recent research supports the idea that adults can facilitate children's learning while\nmaintaining a playful approach in interactions known as 'guided play' (Fisher et al. 2011). The\nadult's role in play varies as a function of their educational goals and the child's developmental\nlevel (Hirsch-Pasek et al. 2009).\n\nGuided play takes two forms.  At a very basic level, adults can enrich the child's environment by\nproviding objects or experiences that promote aspects of a curriculum. In the more direct form\nof guided play, parents or other adults can support children's play by joining in the fun as a\nco-player, raising thoughtful questions, commenting on children's discoveries, or encouraging\nfurther exploration or new facets to the child's activity. Although playful learning can be\nsomewhat structured, it must also be child-centered (Nicolopolou et al. 2006). Play should stem\nfrom the child's own desire.\n\nBoth free and guided play are essential elements in a child-centered approach to playful learning.\nIntrinsically motivated free play provides the child with true autonomy, while guided play is an\navenue through which parents and educators can provide more targeted learning experiences.\nIn either case, play should be actively engaged, it should be predominantly child-directed, and it\nmust be fun.",
